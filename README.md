## Calculator app in Javascript using ReactJS

Wrote a very basic calculator which performs basic operations.

#### Things to add in future 
- [ ] Backspacing indivisual charecters
- [ ]  Calculating more than one operations. For eg. - (1+2+3)
- [ ] Impliment the same with Advanced React hooks
- [ ] Add styling using Tailwind CSS
